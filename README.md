# Before you start

1) Sample of all the REST routes can be viewed in company.rest file
2) try-catch block is not required due to the library express-async-error
3) POST req uses promise chaining due to email (try-catch) would be hectic
4) put (update) routes is not required hence a basic boilerplate has been put
5) The repo's backend is deployed to render.io but the streamlined scripts are still available for fly.io based on React and supports the build files
6) Fill in the env values before deploying to production
7) Company Names and website are validated on uniqueness and required
8) Mongo DB has been used
9) Mail template can be found in theme.html

In case of any doubt ping me personally: Pratik
